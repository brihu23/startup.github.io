                <p class="gallery-button-blurb"> Evera aims to make healthcare more accessible. 70% of all medical decisions depend on blood work, yet a full third of patients never follow through with their doctors’ requests to get blood drawn for important tests. Evera solves this compliance issue by bringing the lab to your home. Evera lets doctors, clinical trial coordinators and consumer health companies order blood draws at the touch of a button. A patient then schedules a convenient at-home appointment, and a phlebotomist gets dispatched. 

Our larger mission is to expand past blood draws and ultimately create a truly vertically integrated telemedicine company that combines the best of in-person, at-home visits and virtual care. We offer 24/7 text and video chat, health coaching, at-home healthcare services on demand, and next generation molecular assays in order to deliver best in class healthcare that is proactive as opposed to reactive. 

Our platform is broken down into 6 key components: (1) Health coaches as the first responders; (2) Virtual/At Home Primary Care; (3) At-Home Urgent Care; (4) Prescription Delivery; (5) At-Home Medical Supply Delivery; (6) Integrated Electronic Health Record. </p>

                                <p> Evera aims to make healthcare more accessible. 70% of all medical decisions depend on blood work, yet a full third of patients never follow through with their doctors’ requests to get blood drawn for important tests. Evera solves this compliance issue by bringing the lab to your home. Evera lets doctors, clinical trial coordinators and consumer health companies order blood draws at the touch of a button. A patient then schedules a convenient at-home appointment, and a phlebotomist gets dispatched. 

Our larger mission is to expand past blood draws and ultimately create a truly vertically integrated telemedicine company that combines the best of in-person, at-home visits and virtual care. We offer 24/7 text and video chat, health coaching, at-home healthcare services on demand, and next generation molecular assays in order to deliver best in class healthcare that is proactive as opposed to reactive. 

Our platform is broken down into 6 key components: (1) Health coaches as the first responders; (2) Virtual/At Home Primary Care; (3) At-Home Urgent Care; (4) Prescription Delivery; (5) At-Home Medical Supply Delivery; (6) Integrated Electronic Health Record. </p>

                                <p> Travelers of diverse genders and sexual orientations are a prized demographic in some destinations, and criminalized in others, giving every tourism business an opportunity or a challenge in the LGBTQ+ market. Or both.

As diversity and inclusion becomes a priority for all global business, hospitality and customer service organizations struggle to find ways to incorporate these values in their own missions and day-to-day operations.

HospitableMe helps destinations and brands define those opportunities and challenges, and strategize ways to address them.   </p>

We started as a brick-and-mortar shop in Easton, MA, which has been part of the community since 1989. We also have an online store and recently launched a subscription box and personal shopping service.

Our mission is to change people’s perception of resale and bring joy and a personal touch to the shopping experience. Through our business, we hope to reduce waste, promote conscious consumption, and keep resources within our local community.

We are a women-owned, family-owned business and are in the process of becoming a certified B Corporation. </p>

                                <p> Kids&#x27; resale, refreshed. Merry Go Rounds is a children’s resale marketplace that makes shopping for kids more sustainable, affordable, and fun.

We started as a brick-and-mortar shop in Easton, MA, which has been part of the community since 1989. We also have an online store and recently launched a subscription box and personal shopping service.

Our mission is to change people’s perception of resale and bring joy and a personal touch to the shopping experience. Through our business, we hope to reduce waste, promote conscious consumption, and keep resources within our local community.

We are a women-owned, family-owned business and are in the process of becoming a certified B Corporation. </p>

                <p class="gallery-button-blurb"> Mentis (formerly SunUp) is a health and wellness company offering a novel hangover preventative solution as its first product. The supplement, which is taken before alcohol consumption, attacks the four root causes of a hangover (acetaldehyde buildup, inflammatory immune response, glutamine rebound, and vitamin and electrolyte loss).

The company was co-founded in August 2016 by Margaret Morse, a Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology major at Yale University, and Liam McClintock, a D1 athlete with experience and expertise in nutritional supplements, in conjunction with the help of Yale professors and accomplished advisors with extensive knowledge in the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and dietary supplement industries.

With limited marketing, Mentis proved its efficacy and demand through sales of $48,000 in its first week on the market. Mentis has been featured in numerous television and printed news outlets, such as Time, Men’s Health, Forbes, Associated Press, Vice, Daily Mail, Yale Daily News, Cosmopolitan, Yahoo!, Men’s Journal, and Fox News.

After the early success of Mentis, the co-founders gained additional business experience through various jobs in finance. Sam Yang, a healthcare entrepreneur, joined the team as Chief Executive Officer in May 2020. Armed with new knowledge and experience, the team is currently refreshing the Mentis brand and product to prepare for a second launch and expansion into additional health and wellness products.

                <p class="gallery-button-blurb"> Nimbus builds and operates premium and flexible commercial kitchens that are optimized for off-premise dining and food delivery. By transforming traditional restaurant infrastructure into state-of-the-art, fully-licensed production kitchens that can be rented hourly, daily, or annually, Nimbus caters to the future of food: off-premise dining. Our facility front-of-house also includes an ordering kiosk, a meal pick-up area, and an event space for community engagement. Nimbus has one facility in the Lower East Side, plans to have five facilities in NYC by the end of 2021, and is working to have a national operating footprint of 100 facilities by 2030, when the off-premise kitchen market is projected to hit $1 trillion.

                                <p> Nimbus builds and operates premium and flexible commercial kitchens that are optimized for off-premise dining and food delivery. By transforming traditional restaurant infrastructure into state-of-the-art, fully-licensed production kitchens that can be rented hourly, daily, or annually, Nimbus caters to the future of food: off-premise dining. Our facility front-of-house also includes an ordering kiosk, a meal pick-up area, and an event space for community engagement. Nimbus has one facility in the Lower East Side, plans to have five facilities in NYC by the end of 2021, and is working to have a national operating footprint of 100 facilities by 2030, when the off-premise kitchen market is projected to hit $1 trillion.

                <p class="gallery-button-blurb"> Jambys is a direct-to-consumer apparel company making clothing for the best part of your day: your free time at home. Young consumers value their downtime, but existing loungewear makes relaxing at home feel like a guilty indulgence. We celebrate chilling, and our unisex clothes are soft, stretchy, and shareable — vibrant colors and patterns that give our customers (the JamFam) something fun to share on their social media at home.


Last fall, we bootstrapped the launch of our first product: boxers with pockets. We sold over 1,000 in the first five days. We&#x27;ve seen exciting early traction over the last six months while iterating on the product, developing a scalable supply chain, and expanding the product line ahead of the holidays, and we&#x27;ve been first-order profitable with customers acquired through paid ads.


My co-founder, Andrew, and I are college friends who met as student-athletes at Yale. Andrew previously worked as a writer and photographer at GQ Magazine, and then as a freelance copywriter and photographer for consumer startups. I previously worked at WeWork as the first hire on their real estate acquisition team. We are a scrappy two-person team surrounded by a great network of expert consultants in digital marketing and apparel production.


We&#x27;re raising an additional $300k in our pre-seed round from family, friends, and strategic investors. I&#x27;d love to schedule a time to share more about our vision for Jambys and to walk you through our plans for the end of the year and beyond. </p>

                                <p> Jambys is a direct-to-consumer apparel company making clothing for the best part of your day: your free time at home. Young consumers value their downtime, but existing loungewear makes relaxing at home feel like a guilty indulgence. We celebrate chilling, and our unisex clothes are soft, stretchy, and shareable — vibrant colors and patterns that give our customers (the JamFam) something fun to share on their social media at home.


Last fall, we bootstrapped the launch of our first product: boxers with pockets. We sold over 1,000 in the first five days. We&#x27;ve seen exciting early traction over the last six months while iterating on the product, developing a scalable supply chain, and expanding the product line ahead of the holidays, and we&#x27;ve been first-order profitable with customers acquired through paid ads.


My co-founder, Andrew, and I are college friends who met as student-athletes at Yale. Andrew previously worked as a writer and photographer at GQ Magazine, and then as a freelance copywriter and photographer for consumer startups. I previously worked at WeWork as the first hire on their real estate acquisition team. We are a scrappy two-person team surrounded by a great network of expert consultants in digital marketing and apparel production.


We&#x27;re raising an additional $300k in our pre-seed round from family, friends, and strategic investors. I&#x27;d love to schedule a time to share more about our vision for Jambys and to walk you through our plans for the end of the year and beyond. </p>
